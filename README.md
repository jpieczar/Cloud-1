# Cloud-1
Cloud-1 repo

This is a part of my WeThinkCode coursework.

The Cloud-1 project comprises of me setting up an AWS account (or any suitable web hosting service) and publishing a simple wordpress site.
The use of a CDN is required and also multiple instances (a minimum if 2 has been chosen).
Autoscaling is also accounted for as well as loadbalancing.
